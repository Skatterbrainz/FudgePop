# Targeting

  * Target devices by specific name or via Collections, or both

# Why 'FudgePop'?

  * Because it started with Chocolatey, and a strange bet with a colleague over beer and coffee.
  * I know that makes no sense at all, but it still tastes pretty darn good!

# Installation

  1. Use the Install-Module cmdlet to install FudgePop: ```Install-Module FudgePop```
  2. Copy and Edit the source **control.xml** and place it somewhere accessible to the remote computers
  3. Run ```Configure-FudgePop``` to configure the control XML location and scheduled task options.
  4. Run ```Start-FudgePop``` to test on the first machine
  5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for other devices.

  * Note: You can use multiple control XML files for different devices or groups of devices if you prefer.

# Management

  * Edit the control XML file to provide the configuration data you desire.
  * Increment the [version] attribute within the [control] element (to insure XML data is read properly on clients)
  * Allow time for clients to run scheduled task to invoke control data updates (or force task to run)
